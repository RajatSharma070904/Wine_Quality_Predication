## 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on predicting the quality of wine using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains physicochemical properties of wine samples, and the goal is to classify them into quality categories. A Random Forest Classifier is employed to build a predictive model.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of:

Various physicochemical attributes (e.g., acidity, alcohol content, pH, etc.)

A target variable representing wine quality (typically rated from 3 to 9)

## 🔍 Approach

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and data splitting.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing feature distributions and correlations.

Model Selection: Implementing a Random Forest Classifier.

Training & Evaluation: Training the model, tuning hyperparameters, and evaluating performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

## 🛠 Dependencies
